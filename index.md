I'm finishing my undergraduate degree in microelectronics and trying to figure out how to think clearly about inverse problems in materials and optics.

Most of my work so far has involved situations where:
- multiple mechanisms fit the same data,
- models work but for unclear reasons,
- and knowing what you *can't* conclude matters more than what you can.

This site is my attempt to document that process as I learn it—not a portfolio of solved problems, but a record of where interpretation gets difficult and why.

**Current status**: Graduating summer 2026, applying to physics/materials PhD programs.
