I’m finishing an undergraduate degree in microelectronics and trying to understand how inverse problems actually behave in materials and optics.

In most of my work so far, I keep running into the same pattern:
- different mechanisms explain the same data,
- models work before I understand why they should,
- and the most important part is often knowing what the data *cannot* tell me.

This site exists because I don’t have a clean framework for that yet.

I’m using it to record where interpretation breaks down, what assumptions I relied on without noticing, and how my thinking changes when those assumptions stop holding. Some entries are careful, some are incomplete, and some are probably wrong.

This is not a portfolio of solved problems. It’s a public record of where I get stuck and how I try to get unstuck.

**Current status**: graduating summer 2026, applying to physics/materials PhD programs.
