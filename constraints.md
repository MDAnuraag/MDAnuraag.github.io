# Constraints

Project-level analysis of what limited interpretation more than computation or resolution.

Each page documents:
- What was measured or computed
- What was claimed
- Which constraints dominated
- What survived vs. what remains non-identifiable

## Projects

- **[AlN electroabsorption](/constraints/aln-electroabsorption/)**  
  Field-dependent UV modulation—ruling out crystalline, free-carrier, and interference mechanisms

- **[Inverse RCWA metrology](/constraints/inverse-rcwa/)**  
  Trench depth recovery under parameter degeneracy and limited measurement diversity

- **[g-C₃N₄ optical transitions](/constraints/gcn-optical-transitions/)**  
  Metal doping and symmetry breaking—structural non-uniqueness limits peak assignment

- **[Alloy configuration sampling](/constraints/alloy-sampling/)**  
  Ensemble-averaged band gaps—finite sampling of combinatorial configuration space

- **[Port metasurface](/constraints/port-metasurface/)**  
  NLoS link recovery—environment non-identifiability dominates design optimization

## Constraint Types

These categories recur across projects:

**[Axiomatic]**: Conservation laws, symmetry restrictions, self-consistency requirements  
**[Measurement]**: SNR, resolution (spatial/temporal/spectral), calibration, averaging  
**[Statistical]**: Finite sampling, rare-event coverage, convergence limits  
**[Fabrication]**: Process tolerances, defects, interfaces, uncontrolled chemistry  
**[Computational]**: Basis sets, functional choice, supercell size, boundary conditions

Most interpretive limits involve multiple constraint types simultaneously.

## Structure

Each constraint page follows:
1. **Observable**: What was actually measured/computed
2. **Claim**: What the analysis supports
3. **Load-bearing constraints**: Which limits dominated (organized by type)
4. **Primary limiting factor**: The constraint that matters most
5. **What this rules out**: Mechanisms eliminated by constraints
6. **What remains non-identifiable**: Surviving ambiguities
7. **Partial disambiguation**: What would help resolve ambiguities
