# Constraints

For each project, this section documents what limited interpretation more than my modeling ability.

Usually it wasn't computation or resolution—it was identifiability, measurement averaging, or fabrication uncertainty.

## Projects

- **[AlN Electroabsorption](/constraints/aln-electroabsorption/)**  
  Spatial averaging in UV-Vis prevented depth-resolved mechanism assignment

- **[Inverse RCWA](/constraints/inverse-rcwa/)**  
  Parameter degeneracy—many geometries produced nearly identical spectra

- **[g-C₃N₄ Optical](/constraints/gcn-optical-transitions/)**  
  Structural non-uniqueness—multiple doping sites gave similar absorption onsets

- **[Alloy Sampling](/constraints/alloy-sampling/)**  
  Finite configuration sampling—50 structures from >10⁶ possible

- **[Port Metasurface](/constraints/port-metasurface/)**  
  Environment non-identifiability—can't separate metasurface gain from channel changes

## Constraint types I've encountered

**[Axiomatic]**: Symmetry, conservation laws  
**[Measurement]**: Resolution, SNR, averaging  
**[Statistical]**: Finite sampling, rare events  
**[Fabrication]**: Tolerances, defects, interfaces  
**[Computational]**: Basis sets, functional choice, supercell size

Most projects hit multiple types simultaneously.

2. What I claimed
3. Which constraints mattered
4. What survived vs. what remained ambiguous
5. What would help resolve it
