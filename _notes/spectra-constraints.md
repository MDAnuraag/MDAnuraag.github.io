title: Spectra Are Constraints, Not Fingerprints

## The confusion I had

Early in my AlN project, I thought: "My model reproduces the spectrum, so the mechanism must be right."

**Why that was wrong**: Many mechanisms produce similar spectra once you average over disorder, geometry, and instrument limits.

---

## What I learned

Matching a spectrum means your model is **consistent** with the data. That's necessary but not enough.

A spectrum compresses information:
- Averages over depth
- Integrates over time
- Smears over instrumental bandwidth

That compression destroys information. Multiple microscopic states produce the same measured curve.

---

## How I use this now

Spectra **rule out** mechanisms—they don't **identify** them.

**Example (AlN electroabsorption)**:
- No visible/NIR response → ruled out free carriers
- UV-localized modulation → ruled out bulk interference
- XRD + UV response → ruled out crystalline electro-optic

After eliminating alternatives, defect-mediated absorption survived—not because it fit best, but because other options failed.

---

## The working rule

Before claiming "mechanism X is responsible":
1. List alternatives that also fit
2. Find measurements that distinguish them
3. Don't claim identification until (2) is done

If I can't do (2), I have consistency, not evidence.

---

## When I've seen this go wrong

- Claiming defect species from absorption onset (many defects have similar energies)
- Assigning peaks to atomic configurations (structure is underdetermined)
- Interpreting dispersion models as physics (effective parameters absorb error)

All substitute "fits data" for "uniquely determined by data."
