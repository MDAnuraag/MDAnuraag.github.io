## The question

When does matching a spectrum support a mechanism,  
and when does it merely fail to contradict one?

---

## The core issue

A spectrum is a compressed observable.

Many different microscopic states can map to the same curve once you average over disorder, geometry, time, and instrumental limits. A good fit often reflects that compression, not unique physics.

---

## What spectra can do

Spectra are good at ruling things out.

They can constrain:

- energy scales,
- allowed vs forbidden regions,
- relative changes under selective perturbations.

If a perturbation isolates a mechanism *and* the spectrum responds, that’s meaningful.

---

## What spectra cannot do

On their own, spectra almost never identify:

- a unique structure,
- a unique defect landscape,
- a unique physical mechanism.

Different models can fit equally well without being physically equivalent.

---

## The common mistake

“This model reproduces the spectrum”  
quietly becomes  
“this mechanism is responsible.”

That step requires an external constraint.

---

## Working rule

Treat spectra as **constraints**, not **fingerprints**.

Use them to eliminate explanations that cannot work.  
If nothing is eliminated, nothing has been learned.
