Short notes on confusions I've encountered—either mistakes I made myself or patterns I've seen often enough to recognize.

Each note addresses one specific error in interpretation and why the intuitive answer is wrong.

**Current count**: 1 (building slowly as I encounter more)

## Inference errors

- [Spectra are constraints, not fingerprints](#spectra-constraints) — when agreement doesn't mean identification

**Coming eventually**:
- Good fits don't imply identifiability
- Sensitivity is not identifiability  
- Averaging destroys information
- When priors do most of the work

**Note**: I'm adding these as I encounter them in real work, not writing them all at once. If the list is short, that's because I'm still learning—not because I've solved everything.
