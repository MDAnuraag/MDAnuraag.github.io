Short clarifications for problems that tend to be misread or over-interpreted.

These are not tutorials or reference material.
They exist to stop me from making the *same mistake twice*.

The focus is always the same:
what the observable actually constrains, and what it doesn’t.

For tools, techniques, and their failure modes, see **[Reading Ledger](/reading-ledger/)**.

- **[Spectra are constraints, not fingerprints](/notes/spectra-are-constraints-not-fingerprints/)**  
  When matching a spectrum is the weakest possible agreement.

- **[Good fits don’t imply good models](/notes/good-fits-dont-imply-good-models/)**  
  Why residuals going down can coincide with identifiability collapsing.

- **[Sensitivity is not identifiability](/notes/sensitivity-is-not-identifiability/)**  
  Parameters that move the output but still can’t be recovered.

- **[Averaging destroys information](/notes/averaging-destroys-information/)**  
  Spatial, temporal, and ensemble averaging as irreversible operations.

- **[When priors do most of the work](/notes/when-priors-do-the-work/)**  
  Cases where conclusions are dominated by constraints, not data.

- **[Inverse problems fail quietly](/notes/inverse-problems-fail-quietly/)**  
  Why non-uniqueness usually looks like success.

- **[Resolution is not information](/notes/resolution-is-not-information/)**  
  How higher resolution can worsen inference.

- **[Reproducible does not mean correct](/notes/reproducible-does-not-mean-correct/)**  
  Deterministic pipelines repeating the same wrong answer.

- **[Where I stop trusting simulation](/notes/where-i-stop-trusting-simulation/)**  
  Practical boundaries learned the hard way.

- **[What I check before believing a plot](/notes/what-i-check-before-believing-a-plot/)**  
  A personal pre-commitment against self-deception.
