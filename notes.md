# Notes

Short clarifications addressing specific interpretive errors.

These notes exist because:
- I made this mistake myself, or
- I've seen it made often enough to recognize the pattern, or
- Standard intuition breaks in a non-obvious way.

**Not tutorials.** For method capabilities and limits, see [Reading Ledger](/reading-ledger/).  
**Not project analysis.** For constraint-specific inference, see [Constraints](/constraints/).

Each note addresses **one confusion** and states why the intuitive answer is wrong.
