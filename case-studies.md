Projects where I tried to apply the framework in [/method](/method/).

Some worked well. Some didn't. All of them taught me something about where interpretation breaks down.

1. **[Inverse RCWA Metrology](/case-studies/inverse-rcwa/)**  
   Summer 2025 internship at KLA — recovered trench depth, couldn't resolve secondary parameters

2. **[AlN Electroabsorption](/case-studies/aln-electroabsorption/)**  
   Field-dependent UV modulation — ruled out several mechanisms, one survived

3. **[g-C₃N₄ Optical Transitions](/case-studies/gcn-optical-transitions/)**  
   Metal doping shifts absorption, but structure is non-unique

4. **[Alloy Configuration Sampling](/case-studies/alloy-sampling/)**  
   First computational project — learned that composition alone doesn't determine properties

5. **[Port Metasurface](/case-studies/port-metasurface/)**  
   Senior thesis (in progress) — simulation vs. deployment mismatch

**Constraint analysis for each**: [/constraints](/constraints/)

**Note**: These are undergraduate projects from 2024-2026. Limited scope, limited data, limited experience. I'm documenting them to see if the patterns generalize.
