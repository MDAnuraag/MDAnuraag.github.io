Each case started ambiguous.
Multiple mechanisms fit the same data.
The work was deciding which ones could be ruled out, and on what grounds.

None of these studies resolved cleanly.
They narrowed the space of explanations under imperfect measurement, incomplete models, and time-bounded judgment.

1. **[Inverse RCWA Metrology](/case-studies/inverse-rcwa/)**  
   Geometry inference from broadband reflectance, where fabrication variability and optical degeneracy limited identifiability.

2. **[Electroabsorption in Amorphous AlN](/case-studies/aln-electroabsorption/)**  
   Field-driven UV modulation analyzed under structural uncertainty, with defect-mediated mechanisms retained after crystalline explanations failed.

3. **[Optical Transitions in g-C₃N₄](/case-studies/gcn-optical-transitions/)**  
   Dielectric response and transition activation examined under symmetry breaking and model dependence.

4. **[Alloy Configuration Sampling](/case-studies/alloy-sampling/)**  
   Constrained exploration of chemically plausible structures where exhaustive search was impossible.

5. **[Metasurfaces for Port NLoS Recovery](/case-studies/port-metasurface/)**  
   RF beam steering considered under multipath, deployment constraints, and fabrication tolerances.

Constraint-level reasoning and failure modes are tracked separately in **[/constraints](/constraints/)**.
