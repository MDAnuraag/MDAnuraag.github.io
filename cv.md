## Experience

### Research

**XJTLU, School of CHIPS** (Taicang, China)  
Undergraduate Research Assistant | Advisor: Assoc. Prof. Jangyong Kim  
Fall 2024 - Present

- Analyzed field-dependent UV transmission in PEALD AlN thin films
- Ruled out crystalline electro-optic and free-carrier mechanisms using XRD, AFM, and spectral constraints
- Isolated defect-mediated electroabsorption as remaining viable mechanism
- First author on manuscript (submitted)

**XJTLU, Department of Chemistry and Materials Science** (Suzhou, China)  
Undergraduate Research Assistant | Advisor: Prof. Heechae Choi  
Spring 2024 - Present

- Computed dielectric response and optical transitions in metal-doped g-C₃N₄
- Used symmetry analysis to explain absorption redshifts from dopant-induced symmetry breaking
- Learned that single-configuration calculations insufficient—ensemble averaging required

**XJTLU, Department of Chemistry and Materials Science** (Suzhou, China)  
Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF) | Advisor: Prof. Heechae Choi  
Summer 2024

- Screened MXene-supported single-atom catalysts for hydrogen evolution
- Learned PBE-level DFT through trial and error on HPC cluster
- Selected for SURF Excellent Poster (86 / 399 submissions)

### Industry

**KLA Corporation** (Ann Arbor, Michigan)  
Applications Engineering Intern  
Summer 2025

- Built inverse-RCWA pipeline for semiconductor process control
- Recovered trench depth across 20+ stack variants (primary parameter)
- Left secondary parameters explicitly unconstrained—data couldn't support them
- Reduced inline measurement time by ~47% through constrained parameter space
