I work on inverse problems where the data fits easily, but the explanation doesn’t.

## Focus

Inverse optical and electromagnetic problems.  
Mostly concerned with what measurements actually constrain, and where models overreach.

## Experience

**KLA Corporation**, Ann Arbor, MI  
*Applications Engineering Intern*  
Inverse optical modelling for semiconductor metrology, with emphasis on parameter recoverability under broadband reflectance.

**Xi’an Jiaotong–Liverpool University (School of CHIPS)**  
*Undergraduate Research*  
Field-dependent optical response in thin films, separating competing mechanisms using structural and measurement constraints rather than curve fitting.

## Education

**Xi’an Jiaotong–Liverpool University**  
B.Eng. Microelectronic Science and Engineering (2026)

**University of Liverpool**  
B.Eng. (Hons), Microelectronic Science and Engineering  
(Double degree)

## Tools

- RCWA and electronic-structure workflows  
- Python (NumPy, SciPy), reproducible pipelines  
- EM simulation, optical spectroscopy, diffraction, surface metrology
