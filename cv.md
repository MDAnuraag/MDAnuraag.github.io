# Anuraag Sharma

**Graduating**: Summer 2026 (B.Eng., Microelectronics)  
**Focus**: PhD programs in physics / materials / computational science

This CV is deliberately incomplete without the rest of the site.

- How I reason about models: [/method](/method)  
- Where inference broke in practice: [/constraints](/constraints)  
- Projects as failure cases, not success stories: [/case-studies](/case-studies)
- Crossing borders and topics led me: [/elsewhere](/cv/elsewhere)

## Education

**Xi’an Jiaotong–Liverpool University**  
B.Eng., Microelectronic Science and Engineering  
Expected Summer 2026 (Direct Year 2 Entry)

**University of Liverpool**  
B.Eng. (Hons), Microelectronic Science and Engineering  
(Double Degree Program)

*Note*: My formal training is engineering-heavy. Most physics depth came from research-driven self-study prompted by model failures rather than coursework.

## Research Experience

### AlN electroabsorption under bias  
**XJTLU — School of CHIPS**  
Advisor: Assoc. Prof. Jangyong Kim | 2024–present  

- Studied field-dependent UV transmission in PEALD AlN thin films.
- Tested crystalline electro-optic and free-carrier mechanisms against structural and spectral constraints.
- Those mechanisms could not be supported by available data.
- Defect-mediated electroabsorption remained consistent but not uniquely identifiable.
- First project where I explicitly documented what the data could *not* determine.

### Optical transitions in doped g-C₃N₄  
**XJTLU — Chemistry & Materials Science**  
Advisor: Prof. Heechae Choi | 2024–present  

- Computed dielectric response and optical transitions using DFT.
- Initially relied on single relaxed geometries; this proved insufficient.
- Transition energies and selection rules depended strongly on local configuration.
- Shifted to small-ensemble sampling after observing unstable optical conclusions.

## Industry Experience

### Inverse optical metrology  
**KLA Corporation — Applications Engineering Intern**  
Summer 2025  

- Built an inverse RCWA pipeline mapping broadband reflectance to trench geometry.
- Found trench depth to be reliably constrained; secondary parameters were not.
- Reduced measurement time by narrowing the admissible parameter space rather than increasing model complexity.
- Reinforced that identifiability matters more than model sophistication.
