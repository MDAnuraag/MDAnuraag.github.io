I work on problems where the model fits but the explanation doesn’t survive contact with measurement.

## What I do

Inverse optical problems.  

Figuring out what measurements actually constrain, and where computation can be confidently wrong.

## Experience

**KLA Corporation**, Ann Arbor, MI  
*Applications Engineering Intern*  
Inverse optical modelling for semiconductor metrology.  
Spent most of the time asking what parameters are recoverable — and which ones never were.

**Xi’an Jiaotong–Liverpool University (School of CHIPS)**  
*Undergraduate Research*  
Field-dependent optical response in thin films.  
Separated mechanisms using structure and measurement limits, not curve fitting.

## Education

**Xi’an Jiaotong–Liverpool University**  
B.Eng. Microelectronic Science and Engineering (2026)

**University of Liverpool**  
B.Eng. (Hons), Microelectronic Science and Engineering  
(Double degree)

## Things I’m careful with

- Inverse problems that look well-posed but aren’t  
- Identifiability in EM and materials models  
- Inference under fabrication, measurement, and model uncertainty

## Tools (used, not advertised)

- RCWA, electronic-structure workflows  
- Python (NumPy, SciPy), reproducible pipelines  
- EM simulation, optical spectroscopy, diffraction, surface metrology
