# About This Site

## What this is

An attempt to think more clearly about inverse problems in materials and optics by documenting my reasoning publicly.

I'm 22, finishing my undergraduate degree, and trying to figure out how to avoid overclaiming when models fit data well but mechanisms remain ambiguous.

This site is my working framework—not finished, not polished, probably naive in places I haven't realized yet.

---

## Why it's public

Making this public forces discipline. It's harder to drift toward overclaiming when past analyses are visible and falsifiable.

The intended audience is:
1. **Future me** (to maintain standards when publication pressure hits)
2. **Future collaborators** (to understand how I think about uncertainty)
3. **Anyone else** working on similar problems who finds the framework useful

## What to expect

**This will change.** I'm starting a PhD somewhere in Fall 2026. As I encounter systems this framework doesn't handle, I'll revise it.

**It's incomplete.** The Reading Ledger has 11 methods but I've only deeply used 5-6. The Notes section has 1 entry. The structure is ahead of the content because I'm building it as I go.

**It might be wrong.** I'm documenting my current understanding, not universal truths. If you spot errors or inconsistencies, let me know.

## Maintenance commitment

I review this site quarterly and update when:
- New projects change previous constraint analyses
- I discover I was wrong about something
- I learn new method failure modes

If it stops being updated, either:
1. The reasoning fully internalized (success), or
2. I abandoned it under career pressure (failure)

## Last major review

January 2026 (initial build)

**If you're a PI I applied to**: This site reflects my actual thinking process, not a curated portfolio. If it looks too cautious or too ambitious, that's real—not positioning.
