**Version 1.0 — January 2026**

I'm trying to build a consistent way to think about a recurring problem in my work:

*Given a structure, what signal should exist? Given a signal, what structure can be inferred?*

This page documents my current approach. It's not a prescription for others, it's a record of what I'm trying to do, so I can check later whether I actually followed it.

## Current workflow

When I start a project, I try to:

1. **State what's actually measured**  
   Not what I wish I'd measured, but what the instrument actually reports.

2. **Write down the forward physics**  
   How do I think the signal gets generated? What assumptions am I making?

3. **List alternative explanations**  
   What else could produce this? Geometry, defects, artifacts, effective parameters?

4. **Make constraints explicit**  
   Measurement limits, fabrication bounds, modeling assumptions, what I'm taking on prior.

5. **Ask what's identifiable**  
   Can I actually separate these effects with this data? Or am I fitting a linear combination?

6. **Stop if I can't distinguish**  
   If the data doesn't support the inference, I try to say so instead of forcing it.

7. **Report bounds, not just conclusions**  
   What survived, what didn't, what would help resolve it.

## Why I'm doing this

I've run into situations where:
- My model fit the data perfectly but I couldn't tell which mechanism was real
- Adding more parameters made fits better but understanding worse
- Agreement with experiment came from error cancellation, not insight

This workflow is my attempt to catch those issues before they become claims.

It's built from mistakes I've made (or almost made) across 5 undergraduate projects. That's not much - I expect this to change as I encounter systems it doesn't handle well.

**Status**: This reflects my thinking as of January 2026. I'm graduating soon and starting a PhD (somewhere). Expect revisions as I learn more.
